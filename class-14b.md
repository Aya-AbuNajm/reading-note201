# What Google Learned About Teams

 **Perfect Team** 
Teams should be focused on collaborating in pursuit of creativity and building new ideas. The best teams are the most collaborative ones. So, try starting a team effort with a different mindset:
- collaborative
-respectful
-and honest
Think of your teammates as people who are on your side working towards a common goodPsychological safety: 
Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team members

Most of all, employees had talked about how various teams felt. ‘‘And that made a lot of sense to me, maybe because of my experiences at Yale,’’ Rozovsky said. ‘‘I’d been on some teams that left me feeling totally exhausted and others where I got so much energy from the group.’’ Rozovsky’s study group at Yale was draining because the norms — the fights over leadership, the tendency to critique — put her on guard. Whereas the norms of her case-competition team — enthusiasm for one another’s ideas, joking around and having fun — allowed everyone to feel relaxed and energized.

One of her favorite competitions asked teams to come up with a new business to replace a student-run snack store on Yale’s campus. 
Rozovsky proposed a nap room and selling earplugs and eyeshades to make money.
 Someone else suggested filling the space with old video games. There were ideas about clothing swaps. Most of the proposals were impractical, but ‘‘we all felt like we could say anything to each other,’’ Rozovsky told me. 
 **‘‘No one worried that the rest of the team was judging them.’’**
  Eventually, the team settled on a plan for a micro­gym with a handful of exercise classes and a few weight machines. 
  They won the competition. (The micro­gym — with two stationary bicycles and three treadmills — still exists.)

 1. Psychological safety:
Do I feel safe to be myself on this team Or do I have to hold back – Do I feel comfortable to ask silly questions, express opinions freely, share my half-formed ideas, admit if I made a mistake, share honest feedback with a colleague, – without the fear of being embarrassed, ridiculed, rejected or punished. If I can do that on my team – then there is a high level of PS on the team.  As psychological safety is the key factor we have a psychological safety team assessment – more details on that are later in the article.

2. Dependability
When team members say that they will do something – can I depend on them to keep their promise and do the work with quality and on time. Or are they unreliable or not dependable?

3. Structure and clarity
As a team member, am I clear of what is expected of me and do I know how to do it?

4. Meaning
Does my work give me a sense of personal and professional fulfillment?

5. Impact
Does my work make an impact for a greater good – It can be in terms of the impact on the team, to the dept., company, customers, or a larger purpose or calling, etc
