- The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image.

In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords :
1. Page Title The page title appears at the top of the browser window or on the tab of a browser. It is specified in the <title> element which lives inside the element.

2. URL / Web Address The name of the file is part of the URL. Where possible, use keywords in the file name.

3. Headings If the keywords are in a heading element then a search engine will know that this page is all about that subject and give it greater weight than other text.

4. Text Where possible, it helps to repeat the keywords in the main body of the text at least 2-3 times. Do not, however, over-use these terms, because the text must be easy for a human to read.

5. Link Text Use keywords in the text that create links between pages.

6. Image Alt Text Search engines rely on you providing accurate descriptions of images in the alt text. This will also help your images show up in the results of image-based searches.

7. Page Descriptions The description also lives inside the element and is specified using a tag. It should be a sentence that describes the content of the page. (These are not shown in the browser window but they may be displayed in the results pages of search engines.)

### How to Identify Keywords and Phrases
![keyword](https://blogs.hct.ac.ae/content/uploads/sites/2/2016/03/keywords.png)
**Brainstorm List** down the words that someone might type into Google to find your site. Be sure to include the various topics, products or services your site is about.

**Organize Group** the keywords into separate lists for the different sections or categories of your website.

**Research** There are several tools that let you enter your keywords and then they will suggest additional keywords you might like to consider.

**Compare** It is very unlikely that your site will appear at the top of the search results for every keyword. This is especially true for topics where there is a lot of competition.

**Refine** Now you need to pick which keywords you will focus on. These should always be the ones that are most relevant to each section of your site.

**Map** Now that you have a refined list of keywords, you know which have the most competition, and which ones are most relevant, it is time to start picking which keywords you will use for each page.
